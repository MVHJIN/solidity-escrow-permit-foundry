# Audit Notes â€” Escrow (Draft)

## Scope
- `contracts/Escrow.sol`

## Threat Model (assumptions)
- Payer and Payee are EOAs (can be contracts but beware reentrancy; guarded).
- Oracle-free; only time and explicit approval.

## Findings (initial)
- None critical/high at this stage.

## Recommendations
- Extend with cancel windows & dispute resolution if needed.
- Consider pull pattern everywhere (already used).
